# Scripts

This repo contains some scripts I have written. Most of them are in bash. Feel free to use them if you want to!

The [`skel`](./skel) script is the skeleton I use for most of my scripts. It contains some basic utilities I use for all my scripts.

Run `make install` after downloading the repository to install them to `~/.local/scripts`.
